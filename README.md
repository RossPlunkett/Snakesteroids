# Snakesteroids
A trivial mixture of Snake and Asteroids using C++ and Raylib

To play and edit, download, unzip and open the .sln in the top level directory with Visual Studio 2019 and run.

Game starts from raylibtest.cpp in the raylibtest folder which also contains the classes.

Arrow keys move, don't backtrack, and the space bar does something too. Enjoy!
